RedAlert was developed by volunteers to provide real-time rocket alerts for Israeli citizens.

* [Official Site](https://redalert.me)
* [Google Play Listing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.red.alert)

The app utilizes real-time alert data provided by the Home Front Command (Pikud Haoref), which makes it extremely fast, reliable, and stable.

> Note: Rocket alerts are detected using the open-source [pikud-haoref-api](https://github.com/eladnava/pikud-haoref-api) Node.js package.
